    "Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) works on a Max-Cut problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea:\n",
    "- We have a set of points (nodes) connected by lines (edges)\n",
    "- We want to split the points into two groups so that as many lines as possible\n",
    "  go between the groups\n",
    "- The number of “between-group” lines is called the cut size which is what will be maximized\n",
    "\n",
    "Why QAOA?\n",
    "- QAOA is a hybrid quantum–classical algorithm for solving optimization problems\n",
    "- The quantum circuit generates solutions\n",
    "- A classical loop adjusts the circuit parameters for optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Plan for this notebook:\n",
    "1. Make a small random graph\n",
    "2. Build a simple QAOA circuit for it\n",
    "3. Run the circuit on Qiskit’s Aer simulator to get measurement results\n",
    "4. Score the results by their cut size\n",
    "5. Compare to the exact best cut for the same graph\n",
    "6. Plot the best split we find\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal: Understand the basics of building, running, and analyzing a quantum circuit in Qiskit\n"
