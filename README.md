This project demonstrates a simple hybrid quantum–classical optimization workflow using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) in Qiskit.

Problem: Max-Cut on a small random graph (n ≤ 6)

Approach: QAOA circuit with a cost & mixer layer, optimized via brute-force classical minimizing 

Benchmark: Compared to exact classical solution (brute force max-cut)

Tools: Qiskit, NumPy, SciPy, NetworkX, Matplotlib

Designed as a one-day demonstration project to understand basics of QAOA
